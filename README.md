## 📈 Key Insights

### Financial Performance

* Revenue grew exponentially (21M → 3.74B)
* Gross Margin % declined over time
* Operational expenses increased steadily
* Net Profit did not scale proportionally with revenue

### Sales, Market & Customer Analysis

* Revenue Leaders Are Profit Laggards. They contributed significant sales but made more losses.
* Smaller Markets More Profitable. France, Philippines, Indonesia consistently appear in top net profit lists.
* India, USA, UK generated high revenue but low profitability
* Amazon & Flipkart drove volume but eroded margins
* Smaller markets like France & Philippines showed better profitability discipline
* 

### Supply Chain Performance

* Forecast accuracy volatility post-COVID
* Absolute Net Error increased significantly
* Recurring excess inventory & stockout issues
* Working capital inefficiencies observed
* Demand planning and inventory alignment not optimized.

### Executive View
* AtliQ achieved exponential revenue growth from FY18 to FY22 (21M → 3.74B).
* However, profitability has not scaled proportionately due to declining GM% and rising operational expenses.
* High-revenue markets (India, USA, UK, Canada) are consistently underperforming in net profit.
* Large customers (Amazon, Flipkart) contribute significant revenue but erode margins.
* Forecast instability post-COVID has increased working capital risk via excess inventory and stockouts.
* Market share slightly improved in FY22, indicating growth push — but at cost of margin pressure.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations

1. Strengthen forecast planning for top revenue-driving SKUs.
   Supply Chain team should:
    Introduce demand-sensing models for top 20 SKUs.
    Monitor monthly forecast bias.
   Specifics:
    Reduce absolute net error by 20%.
    Focus on SKUs repeatedly facing stockouts/excess.
2. Implement margin governance framework for large customers.
   Finance + Sales leadership should implement margin threshold controls for high-volume customers (Amazon, Flipkart).
   Specifics:
    Define minimum GM% per contract.
    Review discount structures quarterly.
    Reduce blanket post-invoice discounts. 
3. Optimize advertising spend through ROI-based evaluation.
   Marketing should evaluate ROI per campaign.
   Specifics:
    Link ad spend to incremental net sales.
    Pause campaigns with low ROI.
4. Classify markets into Growth-focused vs Margin-focused strategy.
   Commercial team should classify markets into:
    Growth-focused (India, USA)
    Margin-focused (France, Philippines)
   Specifics:
    Growth markets → volume strategy but controlled discount caps.
    Margin markets → protect pricing power.
